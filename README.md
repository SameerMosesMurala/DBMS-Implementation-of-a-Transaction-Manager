This project implements a transaction manager that manages concurrency control using locking.
You will implement the strict two-phase locking (S2PL) protocol with shared locks for read and exclusive locks for write. 
The transaction manager handles locking and releasing of objects. Lock escalation (Upgrading) is not considered in this project.
This is a stand-alone project using C/C++ and does not use Minibase.
Portions if the skeletal code is given so you can focus on the important and interesting aspects of Tx management.
